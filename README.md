# To-Do List App 📝

A small and clean **To-Do List application** created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project focuses on managing daily tasks through simple CRUD functionality in the browser, with **LocalStorage support** to save tasks persistently.

## Overview

This To-Do List app allows users to add tasks and remove them easily.  
All interactions happen dynamically without page reloads, and tasks are saved in the browser using **LocalStorage**, so they persist across sessions.

- Simple and minimal user interface  
- No external libraries
